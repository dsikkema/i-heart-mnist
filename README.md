# Intro
This is not a tutorial, but a plain demonstration of several deep learning concepts and algorithms all in context. Its goal is to be light on words, light on explanation, and heavy on code. This way it can give concrete demonstration to the great videos and blogs that are already out there on these topcs.


# What topics are demonstrated?
* Forward pass ("making inferences")
* Training loop
* Cross entropy loss
* Backpropagation and calculation of gradients
* Cosine learning rate decay
* Dropout
